# GitHub Webhook Listener (ver. 2)

[![Build](https://github.com/alexandru/github-webhook-listener/workflows/build/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/alexandru/github-webhook-listener/actions?query=branch%3Amain+workflow%3Abuild) [![Deploy](https://github.com/alexandru/github-webhook-listener/workflows/deploy/badge.svg)](https://github.com/alexandru/github-webhook-listener/actions?query=workflow%3Adeploy)

A simple web app that can be registered as a
[GitHub Webhook](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/)
and trigger shell commands in response to events.

Main use-case is to trigger refreshes of websites hosted on your own
server via CI jobs (e.g., GitHub Actions), but in a secure way, without 
exposing server credentials or SSH keys.

The server process is also light in resource usage, not using more
than 20 MB of RAM, so it can be installed on under-powered servers.
